# Group Task: Improving Performance Through Better Design

## Overview
This is a collaborative exercise focused on algorithm optimization and Big-O complexity analysis. You will analyze an inefficient solution and develop an improved approach.

## Problem Context

You are given a solution that checks whether an array of ratings (0–10) contains duplicate values. The provided solution uses **nested loops**.

## Group Activity Instructions

**Group Size:** 2–3 students

### 1. Analyse the Given Solution

- **What is the Big-O time complexity?**
  - Determine the time complexity of the nested loop approach
  - Consider how the runtime grows as the input size increases

- **Why does it have this complexity?**
  - Identify what operations cause the complexity
  - Explain the relationship between input size and operations performed

### 2. Improve the Algorithm

- **Can you design a more efficient solution?**
  - Brainstorm alternative approaches
  - Consider different algorithmic strategies

- **What key idea or data structure enables the improvement?**
  - Identify the data structure that makes your solution more efficient
  - Explain why this data structure is better suited for the problem

### 3. Compare Complexities

- **Big-O of the original solution?**
  - State the time complexity of the nested loop approach

- **Big-O of the improved solution?**
  - State the time complexity of your optimized approach
  - Calculate the performance improvement

### 4. Space Trade-offs

- **Does the improved solution use extra memory?**
  - Identify any additional memory requirements
  - Quantify the extra space needed

- **What is the space complexity, and is the trade-off worth it?**
  - Express space complexity in Big-O notation
  - Justify whether the time improvement is worth the space cost

## Deliverables

Be ready to share with the class:

1. ✅ Your improved approach (algorithm/pseudocode)
2. ✅ Its time complexity (with justification)
3. ✅ Its space implications (with analysis)

## Tips for Success

- **Test your understanding:** Try implementing both solutions with small examples
- **Think incrementally:** Start by understanding the problem fully before optimizing
- **Discuss trade-offs:** There's often no single "right" answer—understand the pros and cons

## Learning Objectives

- Understand practical implications of Big-O complexity
- Learn to identify optimization opportunities
- Practice analyzing time-space trade-offs
- Develop skills in algorithm design and analysis
